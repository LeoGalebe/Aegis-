    "        \"strengths\": \"Near-instant response to 911 calls or detected incidents, provides aerial surveillance and backup before officers arrive, configurable force options (non-lethal to lethal) under human control, extends coverage and persistence beyond human limitations, improves officer safety and situational awareness with real-time intel\",\n",
    "        \"limitations\": \"Subject to strict legal and regulatory controls (armed drone use in civilian areas is heavily restricted), extremely high cost and technical complexity, requires significant training and maintenance, potential public concern over privacy and use-of-force, relies on stable communications and robust oversight to function safely\",\n",
